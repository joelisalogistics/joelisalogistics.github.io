# Joelisa Logistics Website Update Plan

The goal is to update the website content and structure based on the provided images, maintaining existing styling, animation, and fonts.

## Detailed Steps

1.  **Smooth Scrolling Implementation**: Add jQuery script to page.html for smooth scrolling to anchor links (pending from previous step).
2.  **Global Branding Update**: Replace all instances of "Cargo" with "Joelisa Logistics" in page.html and style.css (if necessary for text content).
3.  **Section Content Replacement/Modification**:
    *   **Home Banner (`#home-section`)**: Update text content to reflect Joelisa Logistics' focus.
    *   **Our Services (`#our-services-section`)**: Replace content with the new "What We Offer" sections (Express Delivery, Fleet & Private Transportation, Smart Freight, Medical Logistics).
    *   **About Us (`#about-us-section`)**: Replace existing "Our story" content with the "Who We Are" copy.
    *   **Features (`#features-section`)**: Replace existing content with the "Why Joelisa?" section.
    *   **Testimonials (`#testimonials-section`)**: Update content to match the new "What Sets Us Apart" section.
    *   **New Sections**: Integrate "Our Mission," "Our Vision," and "Industries We Serve" content, potentially replacing or modifying existing sections to fit the new narrative flow.
4.  **Contact Information Update**: Update email and website links in the header and footer to `info@joelisalogistics.com` and `www.joelisalogistics.com`.
5.  **Final Review**: Ensure all styling, animations, and fonts are consistent with the original template and the new content.
